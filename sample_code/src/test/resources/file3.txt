Roman numbers

Roman numbrs are a numbr system that originated in ancient Rome
and remained the usual way of writing numbrs throughout Europe well
into the Late Middle Ages.

Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from
the Latin alphabet. Modern style uses seven symbols, each with a fixed
integer value:

Symbol:  I    V    X    L    C    D    M
Value:   1    5   10   50  100  500 1000

Example: 42 = XL + II = XLII
